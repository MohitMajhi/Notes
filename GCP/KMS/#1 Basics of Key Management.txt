A cloud Key Management System (KMS) is a coloud service which helps you manage your symmetric and asymmetric keys keys

In a KMS we have a keyring which is used to organize keys within a specific geographic region.

The keys can be categorized into three types:

Generated Keys
Imported keys
Externally Managed Keys

To create keys go to 
Security > Key Manegement

When creating the keys we need to be careful that the keys should be created in the same region as the resources.

And while creating the resource we want to encrypt select CMEK in Data Encrypt and select the key we want to use. 

CMEK - Customer Managed Encryption Key

Commnds to encrypt and decrpyt files using KMS

Command to encrypty 

gcloud kms encrypt \
    --key key \
    --keyring key-ring \
    --location location  \
    --plaintext-file file-with-data-to-encrypt \
    --ciphertext-file file-to-store-encrypted-data
	
Command to Decrypt 
	
gcloud kms decrypt \
    --key key \
    --keyring key-ring \
    --location location  \
    --ciphertext-file file-path-with-encrypted-data \
    --plaintext-file file-path-to-store-plaintext
	
Here we are using a symmetric key to do the encryption and Decrypring the files

Symmetric keys:
--------------

In a Symmetric key cryptiography a single key is used for both encryption and to decrpyt the file.
