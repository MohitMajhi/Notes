Public Key Cryptography or Asymmetric Cryptography:
---------------------------------------------------

It is a cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys. Each pair consists of a public key (which may be known to others) and a private key (which may not be known by anyone except the owner).

In this method we can use the keys in two ways: Encryption and Digital Signature

Encryption:
==========

In the encryption method a key pair can be generated and the public key can be shared to anyone who would be encrypting the file. 

Then they can share the encrypted-data to anyone. But only the person who will have the private key will be able to decrpyt the file.


We can generate asymmetric key by defining assymetric decrypt this will define it as assymetric encryption key and after it is generated we can get the public key fromm it. 

We can use the below command to encrypt data using ssl using pravate key we get form kms

openssl pkeyutl -in cleartext-data-input-file \
    -encrypt \
    -pubin \
    -inkey public-key-path \
    -pkeyopt rsa_padding_mode:oaep \
    -pkeyopt rsa_oaep_md:sha256 \
    -pkeyopt rsa_mgf1_md:sha256 \
    > encrypted-data-output-file
	

And the below command can be used to decrpyt the encrypted-data using the kms key.

gcloud kms keys versions get-public-key key-version \
    --key key \
    --keyring key-ring \
    --location location  \
    --output-file public-key-path
	
	
Digital Signature
=================

A digital signature is a mathematical technique used to validate the authenticity and integrity of a message, software or digital document.

In this method we will use a hashing algorithm on the file to hash it and then encrypt it using out private key and the result we will get will be called a digital signature.

Then if we send this file to anyone the file can be verified by the other person by. 
first the file can can be hashed by using the same hasing method 
and then the public key can be used to decrypt the digital signature. 
After that if we try to matched the hashed file and the decrypted digital signature and if they match that would mean that there has been no tampering in the file. 

To use digital signature when creating key we nned to select Purpose as Assymetric sign.

Gcloud command to create the digital signature

gcloud kms asymmetric-sign \
    --version key-version \
    --key key \
    --keyring key-ring \
    --location location \
    --digest-algorithm digest-algorithm \
    --input-file input-file \
    --signature-file signature-file
	
	
Command to get the public key from command line

gcloud kms keys versions get-public-key key-version \
    --key key \
    --keyring key-ring \
    --location location \
    --output-file output-file
	
Command to authenticate the file

openssl dgst \
    -sha256 \
    -verify public-key-file \
    -signature signature-file \
    message-file
