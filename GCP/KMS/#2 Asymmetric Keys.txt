Public Key Cryptography or Asymmetric Cryptography:
---------------------------------------------------

It is a cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys. Each pair consists of a public key (which may be known to others) and a private key (which may not be known by anyone except the owner).

In this method we can use the keys in two ways: Encryption and Digital Signature

Encryption:
==========

In the encryption method a key pair can be generated and the public key can be shared to anyone who would be encrypting the file. 

Then they can share the encrypted-data to anyone. But only the person who will have the private key will be able to decrpyt the file.


We can generate asymmetric key by defining assymetric decrypt this will define it as assymetric encryption key and after it is generated we can get the public key fromm it. 

We can use the below command to encrypt data using ssl using pravate key we get form kms

openssl pkeyutl -in cleartext-data-input-file \
    -encrypt \
    -pubin \
    -inkey public-key-path \
    -pkeyopt rsa_padding_mode:oaep \
    -pkeyopt rsa_oaep_md:sha256 \
    -pkeyopt rsa_mgf1_md:sha256 \
    > encrypted-data-output-file
	

And the below command can be used to decrpyt the encrypted-data using the kms key.

gcloud kms keys versions get-public-key key-version \
    --key key \
    --keyring key-ring \
    --location location  \
    --output-file public-key-path
