Setting Up AWS to use terraform
===============================

Step 1 : 
--------
Start by installing Terraform to Your Device

Installation page --> https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install?product_intent=terraform

Step 2:
-------
AWS CLI installation

Installation Page --> https://aws.amazon.com/cli/#:~:text=The%20AWS%20Command%20Line%20Interface,and%20automate%20them%20through%20scripts.

Step 3:
-------

Configure and authenticate a User with AWS CLI

Go to AWS and serach IAM
Create a new User in the Users
> Add the USER name. 
> Depending upen need console access can be given by creatign I am user
> Add user to a IAM group
> In the AWS group add the required permission policies to define which services the user can have access to
> Go To users > SElect User > Security credentials and create a new access key --> Downlaod the access key file

Go to the manchine we want to use Terraform in and use command ==> aws configure -> To set up user credentials 

PS C:\Users\alanm\OneDrive\Documents\Terraform> aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx                          |
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  |--> This data will be found in the access key when creating it
Default region name [None]: ap-south-1                                   --> The default region to use in aws
Default output format [None]: json  


This configuration can be found in the Users>usename>.aws>config

This credentials will be used by terraform to authenticate on our behalf to connect to aws

The AWS CLI command syntax typically follows this structure:
------------------------------------------------------------

aws <service> <operation> [parameters]
Here's a breakdown of each component:

aws: This is the command to invoke the AWS CLI.
<service>: The specific AWS service you want to interact with (e.g., s3, ec2, iam).
<operation>: The operation or action you want to perform (e.g., ls for listing, create-bucket for creating an S3 bucket).
[parameters]: Additional parameters or options for the operation (e.g., resource identifiers, configurations).


Eg: To create a user we can use the command:
	
	aws iam create-user --user-name alice
	
when the command is run it will give the details of the user in the configured output format. 

it will also display the arn(amazon rsource number) which is used to identify all the resources in AWS

the "aws <command> help" can be used to get details of any su command and to get details regarding the subcommand we can use "aws <command> <subcommand> help"
